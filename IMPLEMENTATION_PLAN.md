### BUG LIST
- [x] Add File button does not seem to do anything. maybe needs a file picker popup?
- [ ] Drag and drop functionality does not seem to work - don't see any files being added to queue. Perhaps I'm dropping them in the wrong place? not sure.
- [x] Text injected into chat has other information around the processed file's text. We only want the text from the file to be injected, nothing else - FIXED: Now using workbench.action.chat.attachFile to attach the actual file rather than injecting text
- [x] After injecting text, the chat hangs with a "Working" message, and never completes with even a simple prompt being injected. - FIXED: Replaced text injection with file attachment using workbench.action.chat.attachFile + simple "Process this file" instruction
- [x] We should remove the priority for selected files, we don't really care about differentiating by priority. We only want to process the files in the order they're added (for now)
- [x] At the moment only a single file queue works when you press the start button. Any more than one file won't be processed. Probably need a way for the process to know when the chat finished outputing the response before submitting the next one.
- [x] The Auto Permission Manager window not loading, might need to register those services somewhere
- [ ] looks like if a prompt takes too long to process in the chat, the file queue will force the next one after a timeout anyways. We should always wait for the chat to finish outputting it's tokens before injecting the next file (that's the whole point) - can we hook into the chat stream somehow to know when it's finished?


### Integration Points with Existing Codebase

- **Chat Commands**: Integrate with existing chat participant system
- **File Access**: Extend existing file permission system in `toolUtils.ts`

### Key Data Models

```typescript
// Core queue item interface
interface FileQueueItem {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  fileName: string;
  priority: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  addedAt: Date;
  processedAt?: Date;
  error?: string;
  result?: ProcessingResult;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Permission profile for auto-approval
interface PermissionProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rules: PermissionRule[];
  isDefault: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  modifiedAt: Date;
}

// Individual permission rule
interface PermissionRule {
  id: string;
  operation: string;           // e.g., 'read', 'write', 'analyze'
  scope: string;              // e.g., 'workspace', 'file', 'directory'
  autoApprove: boolean;
  conditions?: RuleCondition[];
  priority: number;
}

// Queue processing state
interface QueueState {
  isProcessing: boolean;
  isPaused: boolean;
  currentItem?: string;
  processedCount: number;
  totalCount: number;
  startedAt?: Date;
  estimatedCompletion?: Date;
  errors: QueueError[];
}
```

### API Design

```typescript
// Main queue service interface
interface IFileQueueService {
  // Queue management
  addToQueue(filePath: string, priority?: number): Promise<string>;
  removeFromQueue(itemId: string): Promise<void>;
  reorderQueue(itemIds: string[]): Promise<void>;
  clearQueue(): Promise<void>;

  // Processing control
  startProcessing(profileId?: string): Promise<void>;
  pauseProcessing(): Promise<void>;
  resumeProcessing(): Promise<void>;
  stopProcessing(): Promise<void>;

  // State queries
  getQueueState(): QueueState;
  getQueueItems(): FileQueueItem[];
  getProcessingHistory(): ProcessingResult[];

  // Events
  onQueueChanged: Event<QueueChangeEvent>;
  onProcessingStateChanged: Event<ProcessingStateEvent>;
  onItemProcessed: Event<ItemProcessedEvent>;
}

// Permission service interface
interface IAutoPermissionService {
  // Profile management
  createProfile(profile: PermissionProfile): Promise<string>;
  updateProfile(profileId: string, profile: PermissionProfile): Promise<void>;
  deleteProfile(profileId: string): Promise<void>;
  getProfiles(): PermissionProfile[];

  // Permission evaluation
  evaluatePermission(operation: string, context: PermissionContext): Promise<PermissionResult>;
  autoApproveOperation(operation: string, context: PermissionContext): Promise<boolean>;

  // Audit and logging
  getAuditLog(): PermissionAuditEntry[];
  logPermissionDecision(decision: PermissionDecision): void;
}
```

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Service Registration
Extend existing contribution system:
```typescript
// In contributions.ts
export const vscodeNodeContributions: IExtensionContributionFactory[] = [
    asContributionFactory(ConversationFeature),
    asContributionFactory(FileQueueContribution),  // Add this
    // ... existing contributions
];
```

### 2. Chat Command Integration
Extend existing chat participant system:
```typescript
// Register queue commands with chat participant
participant.registerSlashCommand('queue-add', async (request, context, stream, token) => {
    // Handle adding files to queue
});

participant.registerSlashCommand('queue-start', async (request, context, stream, token) => {
    // Handle starting queue processing
});
```

### 3. Configuration Schema Extension
Add to package.json:
```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "properties": {
      "github.copilot.queue.autoPermissions": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": false,
        "description": "Enable automatic permission approval for queue processing"
      },
      "github.copilot.queue.defaultProfile": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Default permission profile for queue processing"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Queue service operations (add, remove, reorder)
- [ ] Permission rule evaluation
- [ ] Data model validation
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Queue persistence across sessions
- [ ] Chat command integration
- [ ] File access permission validation
- [ ] UI interaction workflows

### Security Tests
- [ ] Permission boundary validation
- [ ] Auto-approval safety checks
- [ ] Audit log integrity
- [ ] User consent flows

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Large queue handling (100+ files)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Processing throughput measurement
- [ ] UI responsiveness under load

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Implement throttling, background processing, resource monitoring
2. **Memory Usage**: Use pagination for large queues, implement cleanup mechanisms
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Follow existing patterns, extensive testing with current features

### Security Risks
1. **Unsafe Auto-Approvals**: Conservative default rules, extensive validation, user overrides
2. **Permission Escalation**: Strict scope validation, audit logging, security boundaries
3. **Data Exposure**: Local storage only, no external transmission, user control

### User Experience Risks
1. **Complexity**: Progressive disclosure, clear documentation, onboarding flows
2. **Confusion**: Intuitive UI design, clear error messages, contextual help
3. **Disruption**: Graceful fallbacks, optional features, existing workflow preservation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Successfully queue and process 10+ files without intervention
- [ ] Auto-approve 95% of common operations safely
- [ ] Maintain queue state across VS Code restarts
- [ ] Complete processing with comprehensive error handling

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Queue operations respond within 100ms
- [ ] File processing throughput matches manual operation speed
- [ ] Memory usage stays within 50MB for typical queues
- [ ] No impact on VS Code startup time

### User Acceptance
- [ ] User can successfully queue and process files on first attempt
- [ ] 90% of operations complete without manual intervention
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Feature feels integrated and native to VS Code

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Kickoff**: Begin with foundation services and basic queue functionality
2. **Architecture Review**: Validate technical approach with team before implementation
3. **Security Review**: Early security validation of permission framework design
4. **UX Design**: Create detailed UI mockups and user flow documentation
5. **Testing Plan**: Develop comprehensive test strategy and automation framework

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to building the File Queue & Auto-Permission feature while maintaining the quality and security standards of the GitHub Copilot Chat extension.
