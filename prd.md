# GitHub Copilot Chat Extension - File Queue & Auto-Permission Feature

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of an enhanced GitHub Copilot chat extension that enables automated file processing through a queue system with auto-permission handling. This feature will allow developers to queue multiple files for processing and let the extension work autonomously without manual intervention.

### 2. Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- GitHub Copilot chat requires manual file selection and individual permission approval for each operation
- Developers cannot batch process multiple files efficiently
- Long-running tasks require constant user presence for permission approvals
- No way to queue work and let Copilot process files autonomously

**User Impact:**
- Reduced productivity due to manual intervention requirements
- Inability to leverage Copilot for batch processing during off-hours
- Frequent context switching interrupting development flow

### 3. Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
- Enable queuing of multiple files for sequential processing
- Implement auto-permission system for unattended operation
- Maintain security while reducing friction
- Provide progress tracking and error handling

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% reduction in manual interventions during batch operations
- Support for queues of 10+ files
- 95% successful auto-permission resolution rate
- User adoption rate of 60% within 3 months

### 4. Target Users

  fileName: string;
  priority: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  addedAt: Date;
  processedAt?: Date;
  error?: string;
  result?: any;
}

interface PermissionProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rules: PermissionRule[];
  isDefault: boolean;
}

interface PermissionRule {
  operation: string;
  scope: string;
  autoApprove: boolean;
  conditions?: string[];
}
```

#### 6.2 Implementation Specifications

- **Remove from Queue**: `removeFromQueue(itemId: string)`
- **Reorder Queue**: `reorderQueue(itemIds: string[])`
- **Process Queue**: `processQueue(profile?: string)`
- **Pause Processing**: `pauseQueue()`
- **Resume Processing**: `resumeQueue()`
